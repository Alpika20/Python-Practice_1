Problem 1:
Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . Print a list of all 
possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops,
as a learning exercise.

Solution:
result = [[i, j, k] for i in range(X + 1) for j in range(Y + 1) for k in range(Z + 1) if i + j + k != N]
print result
